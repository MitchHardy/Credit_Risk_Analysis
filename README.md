# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project is to accurately predict credit risk through supervised machine learning model and analysis. The methods that were used for this analysis are the folling; Naive Random Oversampling, SMOTE, Cluster Centroids, SMOTEENN, Balanced Random Forest Classifying, and Easy Ensemble Classifying. By using each of these methods I was able to predict credit card risk.
